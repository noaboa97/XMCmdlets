# XMC Module testing

There is a file which I used for the development of the XMCmdlets `XMC_GraphQL_Testing_for_XMCmdlets_Development.ps1`.
But mostly I used irectly the GraphiQL Explorer - https://YourServer:Port/nbi/graphiql/index.html which runs on the server and makes testing queries very easy.
